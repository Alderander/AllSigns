## Creating signs
You can create world signs to teleport the player to a world or command signs which are running a specific command when a player touches it.

### World
To create a world sign which teleports a player to a specific world when he touches and is showing how many players are in the world, just create a sign like this and touch it.

So write the sign like that:  
1. world  
2. the name of the world (e.g. lobby) 
3. anything like a description of the world or leave blank  
4. anything like a description of the world or leave blank 

### Command
To create a command sign which executes a specific command when a player touches it, just create a sign like this and touch it.

Write the sign like that:  
1. command  
2. anything like a description of the command or leave blank 
3. the first part of the command  
4. the second part of the command  

So when you are writing your sign like this, it'll execute the command "help". 
1. command
2. this is a test description 
3. help  
4. nothing (leave blank) 

And when you're writing your sign like that, it'll also execute the command "help".  
1. command
2. this is a test description 
3. he  
4. lp
